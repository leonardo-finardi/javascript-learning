# Main topics of study

## let, const and var
Understand the differences between these variable declarations and how they affect variable scope and hoisting.

## Arrow functions
Learn how to use arrow functions as a shorthand for writing functions and how they handle the 'this' keyword.

## Template literals
Explore the features of template literals and how they can simplify string concatenation and formatting.

## Classes
Understand the concept of classes in ES6, how they work and how they differ from constructor functions.

## Destructuring
Learn how to use destructuring to extract values from arrays and objects and how to use default values.

## Modules
Understand how to use the module syntax to organize code into reusable and maintainable modules.

## Promises
Learn how to use Promises to handle asynchronous operations and how to chain them to create complex workflows.

## Iterators and Generators
Explore the concepts of iterators and generators and how they can be used to create custom iterable objects.

## Spread and Rest operators
Understand the uses of the spread and rest operators to manipulate arrays and objects.

## Symbols
Learn about the Symbol data type in ES6 and how it can be used to create unique and immutable identifiers.

## Default parameters
Understand how to use default parameters in function declarations to provide default values for function arguments.

## Async/await
Learn how to use async/await to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous way, and how to handle errors in async functions.

## Map, Set, and WeakMap/WeakSet
Explore the new data structures introduced in ES6 and learn how to use them to solve common programming problems.

## Proxies and Reflect
Understand how to use proxies to intercept and customize the behavior of objects, and how to use the Reflect object to manipulate objects.

## Internationalization
Learn how to use the new internationalization features in ES6 to handle dates, times, currencies, and other internationalization issues in your code.

## Observables
Learn how observables represent a progressive way of handling events, async activity, and multiple values in JavaScript
