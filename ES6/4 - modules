Modules in ES6 provide a way to organize and reuse code in a more modular and maintainable way. Modules are designed to encapsulate related code and expose a public API that can be used by other parts of the program.

Here's an example of how to define a module in ES6:

```javascript
// greeting.js
export function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

export function sayGoodbye(name) {
  console.log(`Goodbye, ${name}!`);
}
 ```

In this example, we're defining a module called greeting that exports two functions: sayHello and sayGoodbye. These functions can be used by other parts of the program by importing the module.

Here's an example of how to import a module in ES6:

```javascript
// main.js
import { sayHello } from './greeting.js';

sayHello('John'); // outputs "Hello, John!"
 ```

 In this example, we're importing the sayHello function from the greeting module using
