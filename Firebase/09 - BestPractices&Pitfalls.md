# Best Practices

## Use efficient data structures

Firestore excels at reading and writing entire documents, so design your data structure accordingly. Avoid storing data that is frequently updated in separate documents to minimize write operations.

## Plan for scalability

Firestore automatically scales to handle high read and write volumes, but be mindful of document read limitations. Distribute data evenly across collections and avoid hotspots to prevent contention and performance degradation.

## Use security rules effectively

Firestore security rules help protect your data, but they can impact performance. Write rules that are granular and efficient to avoid unnecessary document scans and reads.

## Optimize queries

Structure your data and create appropriate indexes to optimize queries. Use the Firestore Query API effectively to fetch only the required data and reduce the amount of transferred data.

## Leverage client-side caching

Firestore SDKs provide built-in client-side caching. Utilize it to reduce the number of network requests and improve read performance. However, be cautious of stale data and handle cache invalidation correctly.

## Implement offline support

Firestore has built-in offline support, allowing your app to work even when the device is offline. Ensure that your app handles offline scenarios gracefully and handles synchronization appropriately when the device is back online.

# Pitfalls

## Lack of transactional operations

Firestore does not provide support for multi-document transactions across different collections. Be aware of this limitation and design your data structure accordingly to avoid the need for complex transactions.

## Cost considerations

Firestore usage is subject to costs, including read, write, and data transfer operations. Carefully plan your data model and optimize queries to minimize unnecessary operations and reduce costs.

## Denormalization complexity

While denormalizing data can improve read performance, it also introduces complexity and requires careful management to keep data consistent across documents. Be mindful of the trade-offs and maintain data integrity.

## No partial updates

Firestore does not support partial updates for documents. Each update operation replaces the entire document. Ensure that you structure your data and updates accordingly to avoid overwriting important fields unintentionally.

## Lack of native search capabilities

Firestore does not provide full-text search capabilities out of the box. If you require advanced search functionality, consider integrating with other search services like Elasticsearch or Algolia.

## Limited support for complex queries

Firestore has some limitations on complex queries, such as joining collections or performing aggregations. If your application requires complex query capabilities, consider using other databases like Cloud Spanner or BigQuery.

Remember to regularly review Firestore's documentation and stay updated on new features and improvements to make the most of Firestore's capabilities while avoiding common pitfalls.
