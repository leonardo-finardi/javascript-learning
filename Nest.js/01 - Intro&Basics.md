# Introduction to Nest.js

Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It draws inspiration from various programming paradigms and combines elements of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, and Functional Reactive Programming. Nest.js is designed to provide a solid architectural foundation and help developers create maintainable and scalable applications.

# Key Concepts

## Modules

In Nest.js, an application is organized into modules. Modules are used to encapsulate related components, such as controllers, services, and providers. Each module serves as a cohesive unit, promoting modularity and maintainability.

## Controllers

Controllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them, and returning appropriate responses. They are decorated with route definitions that specify the HTTP method and route path they should handle.

## Providers

Providers are a central concept in Nest.js. They are used to manage the application's business logic, including services, repositories, and other components. Dependency injection is a key aspect of Nest.js, where providers are injected into controllers and other providers as needed.

## Dependency Injection

Nest.js leverages dependency injection to manage the relationships between different components. This approach promotes loose coupling and facilitates testing and modularization.

## Decorators

Decorators are used in Nest.js to add metadata and configure various elements of the application, such as routes, parameters, and validation rules.

# Getting Started

## Installation

To start using Nest.js, you need to install it. You can use the Node Package Manager (npm) or Yarn for this purpose:
```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

## Creating a New Project

After installing the Nest.js CLI, you can create a new project by running:

```bash
nest new project-name
```

## Module and Controller Setup

A new Nest.js project comes with a default module and controller. A controller is created with an associated route:

```javascript
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  @Get()
  getHello(): string {
    return 'Hello, Nest.js!';
  }
}
```

## Running the Application

You can start the Nest.js application using the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the server, and you can access the default route at http://localhost:3000.

# Conclusion

Nest.js provides a powerful and structured way to build server-side applications using Node.js. Its modular architecture, dependency injection, and decorators make it a versatile framework for creating maintainable and scalable applications. This crash course covered just the basics, and there's much more to explore as you dive deeper into Nest.js.
